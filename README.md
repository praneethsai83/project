Crop Insurance Revenue Protection Product Design and Pricing

In India, the current Pradhan Mantri Fasal BhÄ«ma Yojana (PMFBY) is a broad risk insurance to protect yield losses due to the risks which are inevitable. PMFBY covers the yield risk faced by the farmers, but does not cover the price risk taken on by the government. The loss due to price risk occurs when government accepts to procure the harvest at Minimum Support Price (MSP) and market price is lower than MSP. This study, proposes a revenue protection insurance product which would help in effectively transferring some portion of the price risk to insurance and reinsurance companies, to reduce the losses faced by the government due to price risk (i.e. the market price being lower than minimum support price).
